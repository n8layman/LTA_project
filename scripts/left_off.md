# Where we left off

The heirarchical sums don't make sense for the mianus segment tooltips. In particular line doesn't always seem to reflect the sum of segments. Example of MRG-1-Unf-2 which should have a line sum of 9 but shows 4? Also the two ggplot2 plots show the same data despite switching between the two site tabs. Should be different.

We should also implement single row click only on data table and highlight appropriate segment

No data for mohonk? Should be some nymphs must not be joining correctly.
